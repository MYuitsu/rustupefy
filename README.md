A series of scripts to automagically transform vim into a stunningly beautiful and fast IDE for rust

**From this**
![simple vim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/assets/bare_vim.png)

**To this**

**And crazy responsive like this**

This script is aiming to jumpstart non-vim users to be able to use minimally configured vim for Rust development.

**If you have been using vi before, this script might not be for you**

## Ubuntu
### Installing

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/ubuntu/setup.sh | sh

```

### To update, run the same script as above

```sh

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/ubuntu/setup.sh | sh

```

### You don't like it?

```sh

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/ubuntu/uninstall.sh | sh

```

## Arch Linux
### Installing

```sh
sudo pacman -S curl

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/arch/setup.sh | sh

```

### To update, run the same script as above

```sh

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/arch/setup.sh | sh

```

### You don't like it?

```sh

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/arch/uninstall.sh | sh

```

The script will undo as much as it can, but not guaranteed as it was before.

## Void Linux
### Installing

```sh
sudo xbps-install curl

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/void/setup.sh | sh

```

### To update, run the same script as above

```sh

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/void/setup.sh | sh

```

### You don't like it?

```sh

curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/rustupefy/master/void/uninstall.sh | sh

```

The script will undo as much as it can, but not guaranteed as it was before.


## What are the plugins installed
- [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
- [rust.vim](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim)
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
- [vim-numbertoggle](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle)
- [vim-racer](https://github.com/racer-rust/vim-racer)

## I wanna learn it step-by-step.

**[Here is how is it done manually](https://github.com/ivanceras/rust-vim-setup)**



# Basic Controls
	CTRL-t          open or close nerdtree
	CTRL-n          toggle relative / absolute numbering
	CTRL-w w        switch focus on nerdtree and open windows
	h,j,k,l         navigate the cursor left, down, up, right respectively
	i               insert mode, you can start typing in your code
	<ESC>           go back to normal/default mode, where you can issue vi commands
	:w              write/save the file, you are editing
	:wqa            save the file, then quit the editor closing vi including the files tab
	<F2>            set focus on the nerd tree

## Rust specific commands
	CTRL-x CTRL-o           activate auto rust autocompletion (example: type in `String::` then press CTRL-x CTRL-o then select from the drop down list the appropriate functions)
	gd                      go to function/struct/variable declaration of the focused item ( this is equivalent to eclipse' open declaration )
	gD                      go to declaration split open in window tab
	:bp                     to go back to the previous edited file (very useful when following a declaration)
	:b <part of filename>   when you have open a lot of files, this comes in handy in showing back the previously open files
